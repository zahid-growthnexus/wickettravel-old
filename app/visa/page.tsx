/**
 * /visa — the dedicated Dubai / UAE visa page.
 *
 * The enquiry form here is the SAME component the homepage banner opens in a
 * modal (components/VisaEnquiryForm.tsx): identical fields, validation and
 * multipart POST to /api/visa-enquiry. The only difference is that it sits
 * inline on the page, where the supporting content around it can do the
 * reassurance work a modal has no room for.
 *
 * The hero is written out rather than reusing <PageHero>: this is a conversion
 * page, so it needs a CTA pair and a photo, which PageHero (a title/lead banner
 * for the static content pages) deliberately does not take. Every token below
 * is PageHero's — same navy gradient, same breadcrumb treatment — so it reads
 * as the same family, not a new one.
 *
 * UAE-only service, so no country picker; and no prices anywhere, matching the
 * rest of the site.

const VISA_FAQ = [
  {
    question: "How long does a Dubai visa take to process?",
    answer:
      "Most UAE tourist and visit visa applications are processed within a few working days once your documents have passed our review. Processing times are set by the UAE authorities rather than by us, so instead of quoting a headline number your visa expert gives you a realistic window for your specific case on the callback — and keeps you updated until the visa is issued.",
  },
  {
    question: "What documents do I need for a UAE tourist visa?",
    answer:
      "Typically a passport valid for at least six months from your travel date, a clear passport-style photograph, proof of your UK status if you are not a British passport holder (for example a BRP or share code), and your travel and accommodation details. You do not send anything through this form — your expert confirms the exact list for your case on the callback, then reviews each document before anything is submitted.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between a tourist visa and a visit visa?",
    answer:
      "A tourist visa covers a short leisure trip and is issued for a fixed stay, usually 30 or 60 days. A visit visa is normally used when you are visiting family or friends in the UAE, or staying longer, and generally involves a host or sponsor in the country. If you are not sure which one fits, choose \"Not sure yet\" on the enquiry form — working that out is part of the eligibility check.",
  },
  {
    question: "I have been refused a UAE visa before. Can you still help?",
    answer:
      "Yes, and please tell us in the notes when you enquire. A previous refusal does not automatically rule out a new application, but it does change how the application should be prepared and presented. Because we check eligibility before you pay, you will know where you stand before committing to an application that is unlikely to succeed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to apply in person or visit an embassy?",
    answer:
      "No. UAE tourist and visit visas are handled electronically, so there is no embassy appointment and no travelling to an office. Everything is done remotely with your Wicket Travel visa expert by phone, WhatsApp and email, and the approved visa arrives by email.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you arrange visas for my family or a group?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Mention how many travellers you are applying for in the notes on the enquiry form and your expert will handle the whole group together on a single callback, so you are not repeating the same details application by application.",
