/**
 * /hotels — Wicket Travel's hotel showcase.
 *
 * Wicket Travel books flights; hotels are fulfilled by the sister brand
 * (see lib/links.ts). This page therefore *showcases* stays and hands the
 * booking itself to Wicket Travel Holidays rather than pretending to run a
 * hotel reservation system here. Two consequences shape the whole page:
 *
 *   1. The hero's search panel is explicitly an EXAMPLE — static text in
 *      field-shaped boxes, never <input>/<form> elements — so nothing here
 *      can read as a local booking flow that doesn't exist. The one real
 *      control is the link out to Holidays.
 *   2. Stays are presented by destination and category, not as named
 *      properties, because Wicket Travel can't verify a specific hotel's
 *      inventory from this side of the brand. No prices anywhere, per
 *      PRODUCT.md principle 4 ("every fact is soft-verifiable").
 *
 * Motion follows the trimmed homepage standard: no scroll-reveals, colour
 * transitions and a 2px lift only. The page is a server component and ships
 * no JS of its own.
