      "Cabin baggage is included on every ticket we issue; checked baggage depends on the airline, the cabin and the specific fare you book. Economy fares can include anything from no checked bag to one, while Premium Economy, Business and First almost always include one or more. We confirm the exact allowance for your ticket before you pay, and you can tick 'include checked baggage' in the search above so we only show fares that carry it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change or cancel my flight after booking?",
    answer:
      "That is set by the airline's fare rules, not by us. Most Economy tickets allow a date change for a fee plus any difference in fare, and many are non-refundable once the free cancellation window has passed. Premium and Business fares are usually more flexible. Tell us what you need before you book and we will point you at a fare whose rules actually fit your plans, then handle the change with the airline if things move later.",
  },
  {
    question: "How early should I check in and get to the airport?",
    answer:
      "Online check-in usually opens 24 to 48 hours before departure and is the easiest way to secure your seat. At the airport, arrive around 2 hours before a short-haul departure and 3 hours before a long-haul one from a UK airport — more if you are travelling with children, need special assistance, or are flying at a peak time such as a school holiday.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a visa for the country I am flying to?",
    answer:
      "Entry rules depend on your nationality, the country you are visiting and how long you are staying, so always check the requirements for your own passport before you fly. If you are flying to Dubai or elsewhere in the UAE, we handle UAE tourist and visit visa applications ourselves — start a visa enquiry and our team will tell you exactly what you need.",

       #dubai-visa banner anchor — same service, but the real page is the
       stronger internal-link target and carries the full enquiry form. */

  },
  {
    question: "Can I choose my seats or book special assistance?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Seat selection is available on most airlines — some include it in the fare, others charge for it, and we will tell you which applies. Wheelchair assistance, medical requirements, dietary needs and travelling with an infant all need to be requested with the airline in advance, so call or WhatsApp our team once you have booked and we will arrange it for you.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is a direct flight always the better choice?",
    answer:
      "Not always. Direct is faster and simpler, and on routes like London to Dubai, Delhi or New York it is widely available. On routes such as Manchester to Mumbai or Birmingham to Cape Town, a one-stop itinerary through a major hub is often the only sensible option and can also be the better-value one. Set 'Direct only' in the search above if it matters to you, or leave it open and we will show you both.",

            Was a text-only PageHero banner followed by a flat bg-primary-900
            strip for the search widget — every other service page (Hotels,
            Car Rentals, Visa) has a full-bleed photo hero, so Flights read as
            noticeably plainer despite being the site's actual funnel. Now
            matches that same photo-hero pattern (see app/hotels/page.tsx):
            full-bleed image, two-pass scrim, breadcrumb, h1, lead, trust
            pills. Reuses the homepage's own hero photo — an aircraft wing —
            since it's already self-hosted and it's literally the page's
            subject.

            The widget itself is NOT overlapped on the photo the way the
            homepage does it: that overlap's negative margins are tuned to
            the homepage's specific fixed/transparent header and photo
            padding (see Hero.tsx's own comment — "measured, not guessed").
            This page's header is the normal sticky one, not fixed, so
            copying those exact pixel values would reintroduce a real
            misalignment rather than fix one. Instead the widget sits in its
            own section directly below, full width, on the same left edge as
            the hero content (`container-page`, no extra `mx-auto`). */}

                  Flights are our craft and our sole focus. We compare live
                  pricing across the world&apos;s leading airlines, show you the
                  best fare genuinely on offer for your route, and hand you
                  straight to the airline&apos;s own booking — no reseller
                  mark-up bolted on at the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And when a fare needs a human — a complicated routing, a date
                  that has to move, a family travelling together — a real UK
                  agent picks up, at any hour.
