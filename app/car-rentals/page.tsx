/**
 * /car-rentals — Wicket Travel's car hire showcase.
 *
 * Wicket Travel books flights; car hire (like hotels and packages) is fulfilled
 * by the sister brand — see lib/links.ts, which routes every non-flight product
 * to HOLIDAYS_URL. This page therefore *showcases* the product and hands the
 * booking itself to Wicket Travel Holidays. Same rules as /hotels:
 *
 *   1. The hero's pickup/drop-off panel is explicitly an EXAMPLE — static text
 *      in field-shaped boxes, never <input>/<form> elements — so nothing here
 *      can read as a local rental booking engine that doesn't exist. The one
 *      real control is the link out to Holidays.
 *   2. Vehicles are shown by CLASS (capacity, luggage, transmission, doors),
 *      never as a named model at a named rate. No prices, daily rates or
 *      currency figures anywhere, per PRODUCT.md principle 4.
 *   3. Partner brands are typeset wordmarks, not logo marks — the same rule
 *      components/AirlineLogos.tsx follows: we never fabricate or distort a
 *      mark we have not been licensed to reproduce.
 *
 * Motion follows the trimmed homepage standard: no scroll-reveals, colour
 * transitions and a 2px lift only. Server component, ships no JS of its own.

      "Most partners rent to drivers aged 21 and over, and some classes — luxury saloons and larger vans in particular — are restricted to 25 and over. Drivers under 25 are usually subject to a young-driver surcharge, which the rental desk states in full on the terms before you agree to anything. Tell us the driver's age when you enquire and we will only show you classes they can actually be given.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which driving licence do I need, and do I need an IDP?",
    answer:
      "A full UK photocard licence held for at least a year covers most destinations, and you must bring the physical card — a photo of it is not accepted at the desk. Some countries also want an International Driving Permit alongside it; the UAE accepts a UK licence for tourists, while several other destinations do not. IDPs are issued over the counter at UK Post Offices. We will confirm which applies to your destination in writing before you travel.",
  },
  {
    question: "What insurance is included, and what is the excess?",
    answer:
      "Rentals arrived through our partners include collision damage waiver and theft protection as standard, with a damage excess you remain liable for. That excess amount, and the deposit held on your card at the desk, are both shown in full on the rental terms before the booking is confirmed — never sprung on you at pick-up. Excess-reduction cover can be added at the desk or bought separately from a UK insurer; either is fine, and we will not push you towards one.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I drive the car across a border?",
    answer:
      "Sometimes, but never assume it. Cross-border travel has to be declared before you collect the car so the right documentation and insurance extension travel with it, and some partners exclude certain neighbouring countries outright. Tell us the route when you enquire — if the crossing is not permitted on that booking, it is far better to find out from us than at a frontier post.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the fuel policy work?",
    answer:
      "The usual arrangement is like-for-like: you collect the car with a full tank and return it full, refuelling near the drop-off point and keeping the receipt. If it comes back short, the desk refuels it and charges for doing so. A few locations only offer a pre-purchased tank instead, in which case unused fuel is not refunded — we will tell you which policy applies to your booking before you confirm it.",
