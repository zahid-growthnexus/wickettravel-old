/**
 * One listing's own page — reached by tapping any card on the main
 * /parents-tickets carousels or either full list page
 * (components/AssistFamilyCarousels.tsx, components/ParentsBoard.tsx). There
 * is no per-listing API, so the actual lookup happens client-side in
 * ListingDetail against the same public feed every other surface reads; this
 * server file only supplies the shell, metadata and breadcrumb.
 *
 * noindex: these are thin, ephemeral pages tied to one row of a live feed
 * that can vanish the moment it's matched — nothing worth sending search
 * traffic to directly. `follow` stays on so link equity still flows through
 * to the two evergreen, indexable list pages linked from here.
