      <P>
        Wicket Travel books flights as an intermediary between you and the
        operating airline. Refunds are governed first and foremost by the
        fare rules the airline attached to your ticket at the time of
        booking — we help you claim what you&apos;re entitled to, but we
        cannot override an airline&apos;s own fare conditions.
