          Wicket Travel is a UK-based flight ticket booking service. We act as
          an intermediary: we compare fares across airlines, help you find
          the best available price for your route, and take your booking
          through to confirmation with the airline or via our booking portal.
        </P>
        <P>
          Flights are our sole focus. Hotels, car rentals and holiday
          packages shown or referenced on our site are provided by our sister

        <P>
          When you ask us to book a flight, we search live availability and
          fares and present you with options. A booking is only confirmed
          once payment has been taken and you receive a confirmation with a
          booking reference / PNR from us or the airline. Until then, no
          fare, seat or price is guaranteed.
        </P>
        <P>
          Some enquiries (for example, our Dubai visa or Parents Tickets
          forms) are handled as assisted, human-reviewed requests rather than
          instant bookings — our team will contact you to complete the
          process.

          Fares are set by airlines and can change until a booking is
          confirmed and paid for. We aim to show the best available fare at
          the time you search. Any service or administration fee we charge
          will always be shown to you clearly before you pay — we do not add
          hidden charges at checkout.
        </P>

          application or an amendment), the amount is{" "}

          and will be disclosed before you agree to it. Payment is processed
          securely by our payment provider or booking portal; we do not store
          full card details.
