/**
 * Parents Tickets — marketing banner only. The community board and enquiry
 * form are retired for now; enquiries come in by phone or WhatsApp, where a
 * real person arranges the introduction.
 *
 * Styling only deliberately kept distinct from CallUsBand two sections up:
 * same copy, same phone/WhatsApp CTAs, but a light card instead of a second
 * flat-navy block, so the two don't read as twins in the scroll. No content
 * was invented to do this — an icon medallion stands in for CallUsBand's
 * agent photo (no equivalent photo exists for this service), and the accent
 * phone button keeps its brand colour so it still reads as "the call button"
 * site-wide. Content-level differentiation (a dedicated photo, or merging
 * this with CallUsBand into one panel) is a decision for the client, not a
 * design guess — see WORK-STATUS.md.
