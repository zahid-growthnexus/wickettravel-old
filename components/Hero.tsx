          for, and the shorter run makes the row scan as one instrument rather
          than a band stretched across the page.

          Deliberately NOT centred. This block used to carry `mx-auto`, which
          centred the widget inside the container independently of the hero copy
          above it — at 1440 that put the title's left edge at 112.5px and the
          widget's at 154.5px, a 42px step that read as a misalignment rather
          than as an inset. With no inline margins the shrunk box sits on the
          container's inline-start edge, so the widget, the h1 and the header
          wordmark all share one left edge at every breakpoint. Margins are left
          unset rather than set to `mr-auto` so the alignment follows `dir` and
