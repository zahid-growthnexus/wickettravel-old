/**
 * The four category photos were re-shot (re-sourced) in this pass. Previously
 * this was the least convincing imagery on the page: "Flights" reused the exact
 * aircraft-wing photograph already carrying the hero, the Emirates fare card and
 * the Luton city card — its fourth appearance on one page — while "Hotels" was a
 * stone cottage that read as a rural B&B against copy promising 5-star resorts,
 * and "Car Rental" and "Packages" were dark, near-unreadable crops of an
 * ambiguous subject. Every other photo section on this page shows plainly what
 * its label says; this one did not.
 *
 * The replacements were chosen against three rules, and each was reviewed at
 * card size before being committed rather than picked off a filename:
 *   1. the subject must be legible at 3/4 portrait under the section's scrim;
 *   2. no photo may repeat a subject used elsewhere on the page — so hotels is
 *      an interior suite rather than another resort pool, which would have
 *      pre-echoed the resort grid two sections below;
 *   3. one register across the four — real places and objects, mid-saturation.
 * Sources are stored portrait (800×1067) to match the frame instead of being
 * cropped down from a landscape plate.
